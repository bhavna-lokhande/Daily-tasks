1. Using input() function take one number from the user and using ternary operators check whether the number is even or odd

Code:
# Take input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is even or odd using a ternary operator
result = "Even" if number % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

# Printing the result
print(f"The number {number} is {result}.")

===================================================================

2. Using input function take two number and then swap the number.

Code:
# Take two numbers as input from the user
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Printing the numbers before swapping
print(f"Before swapping: number1 = {number1}, number2 = {number2}")

# Swap the numbers
number1, number2 = number2, number1

# Printing the numbers after swapping
print(f"After swapping: number1 = {number1}, number2 = {number2}")

===================================================================

3. Write a Program to Convert Kilometers to Miles
code:
# Take input from the user for kilometers
kilometers = float(input("Enter distance in kilometers: "))

# Conversion factor
conversion factor = 0.621371

# Convert kilometers to miles
miles = kilometers * conversion factor

# Printing the result
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles:.2f} miles.")

===================================================================

4. Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.
code:
# Take input from the user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount (in Rs): "))
rateofinterest = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rateofintrest * time) / 100

# Printing the result
print(f"The Simple Interest on Rs. {principal} for {time} years at {rateofintrest}% per year is Rs. {simple_interest:.2f}.")
